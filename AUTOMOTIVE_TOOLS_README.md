## Usage Examples

### Carburetor CFM Calculation
```typescript
import { EngineFormulas } from '@/lib/automotive/engine-formulas';

// Calculate CFM for a 350 CI stock engine
const cfm = EngineFormulas.calculateCFM(350, 'stock'); // Returns 566.3 CFM
```

### Compression Ratio Analysis
```typescript
// Calculate HP change from 9:1 to 10:1 compression
const result = EngineFormulas.calculateCompressionHPChange(300, 9.0, 10.0);
// Returns: { hpPercentChange: 3.8, newHorsepower: 311.4, warnings: [...] }
```

### Gear Ratio Calculations
```typescript
import { DrivetrainFormulas } from '@/lib/automotive/drivetrain-calculations';

// Calculate gear ratio from teeth count
const ratio = DrivetrainFormulas.calculateGearRatio(41, 11); // Returns 3.73:1
```
