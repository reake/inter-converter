        question: 'Why do some timestamps have more digits?',

      },
      {
        question: 'How do I handle timezone conversions?',
        answer: 'Unix timestamps are always in UTC. To display in local time, you need to apply the timezone offset. Our converter handles this automatically when you select different timezones.'

        question: 'What happens in the year 2038?',
        answer: 'The Year 2038 problem affects 32-bit systems that will overflow. However, 64-bit systems (now standard) can handle timestamps far into the future without issues.'
