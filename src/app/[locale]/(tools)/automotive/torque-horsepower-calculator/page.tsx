    theory: 'Torque and horsepower are related by RPM through the formula: HP = (Torque ร RPM) รท 5252. Torque is the twisting force applied to the crankshaft, while horsepower is the rate of doing work. They are mathematically equal at exactly 5252 RPM due to the conversion constant. This relationship is fundamental to understanding engine performance characteristics.',
