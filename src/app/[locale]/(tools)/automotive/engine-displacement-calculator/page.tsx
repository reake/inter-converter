    theory: 'Engine displacement is the total volume swept by all pistons in an engine during one complete cycle. It\'s calculated by multiplying the area of the cylinder bore by the stroke length and the number of cylinders. Displacement is a key factor in determining an engine\'s power potential, with larger displacement generally allowing for more power production.',
